# FlashCards!
-------
### Overview

FlashCards is a game that simulates a question and answer game in the form of "flashcards". This game is played through the command line and is made entirely in JavaScript by utilizing Test Driven Development.

- The user is first prompted with questions
- The user then selects their answer
- Finally, at the end of the game, the user will see a percentage of how many questions were answered correctly.
